##Description:  
Great ideas don't come fully formed -- they come in pieces, sometimes months and years apart.  
Record your best thoughts, plans, and designs. 
Color-code to match potential combinations.

###Executive Summary

SparkFile is a personalizable idea capture tool -- enabling the user to better manage,  
compile, and link ideas. Good ideas rarely come together fully formed. Instead,  
ideas usually develop one piece at a time, and often are adapted and reused after  
a lackluster implementation. For example, one might think of a great set of data  
that would make an excellent market product. Unforunately, the way to present this
data to the end-user is not immediately clear. Months later, work on a completely unrelated  
project may inspire a presentation model. Combined with a design sketch made several years  
prior, this idea could be ready for more serious consideration.  

This workflow is often unappealing, because it seems challenging. Yet this  
often realistically reflects how ideas form--the "aha" moments usually represent  
incremental progress rather than lightning-in-a-bottle.


SparkFile encourages, enables and enhances this process, providing an interface 
featuring color-coded, reorderable, arcivable notes to enhance visual and 
mental connections between fragments of ideas. 

The app uses a single main view controller to control the thought capture process.  
Aside from input, the app enables users to sort ideas by color as well as a free-flowing,
user-generated sort. Ideas are meant to be fluidly reshuffled, revised, and recolored.  
An unordered archived notes page is also available -- although notes can be moved  
back into the main collection areas.

SparkFile must acknowledge the hard work put into Font-Awesome, FlatUIColors.com,  
LXReorderableCollectionViewLayout, and FlatUIKit. The app simply would not have 
come together if the people behind these projects did not release their work to  
the online community.
